# Library Catalog System

## Description
The **Library Catalog System** is a simple console-based application that allows users to manage a collection of books. Users can add new books, search for books by title or author, and list all available books in the catalog.

This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and file handling in Java (or whatever language you're using). It's designed for small libraries or personal book management.

## Features
- **Add a New Book**: Users can add books by providing the book title, author, and publication year.
- **Search Books**: Users can search for books by title or author.
- **List All Books**: Display all the books in the catalog in a readable format.
- **Persistent Storage** (Optional): Books can be saved to a file to maintain the catalog between sessions.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/library-catalog-system.git
